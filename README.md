# end-to-end-comment-classification
It is an end to end multilabel-multiclass text classification deployed using Flask.

Two different models have been used to compare-

1.Bi-Lstm: The model has been trained on and then been used to predict for further values.

2.Mutichannel-Cnn: It has been used for training for different n-grams and then this model has been used for deployement using flask because of its lesser training time and similar accuracy
